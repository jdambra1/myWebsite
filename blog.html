            <h2>Describe the Purpose of IT in Modern Business</h2>
                <br>
                 <p>
                    IT is essential to modern business. Social media is a fantastic tool to market and strengthen brand image/ recognition. This is used in both small and large businesses.
                    Examples would be Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Communication is another element that IT is used in modern business. Not just between business to customer, 
                    its used internally and business to business. Examples could include- emails, zoom and trello. IT is used for databases. This is for collecting information on market research, 
                    client lists, payroll - the list is literally endless! Finally, Using softwares. For example a photography business will use photoshop
                 </p>
                <br>
            <h2>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h2>    
                  <br>
              <h3>Skills</h3>
                <br>
                 <p>There are various skills you can employ to ensure the completion of a digital project. If the project is a group one then communication will be a key skill. The project will 
                     soon start to encounter problems if the communication between team members isn’t up to a certain level. Just for an example two team members could start doing the same task 
                     at them same time being a massive waste of time. 
                    <br>
                    Time keeping is an essential skill to keep to deadlines. This will affect many parts of a project such as completion time. The delays will potentially cost money and risk the
                    reputation of the business.
                </p>
                  <br>
              <h3>Methods</h3>
                 <br>
                    <p>Waterfall is a common method used by modern businesses. The definition is as follows “Waterfall is a linear process for design and development, where line items for creating 
                     the software are set and completed in order. Put succinctly, once one step is complete, the team moves onto the next step. The team typically can’t go back a step without starting 
                     over from the beginning of the process, as each step is contingent on the ones leading up to it.” [1] This is similar to critical path management and ensures streamlining in a 
                     business. Once tasks are determined and whichever task is dependant on anothers completion are ordered logically to ensure the most effective route to completion. For example if 
                     you were to make a cup of tea you have to add the boiling water to the tea bag in the mug before you add milk. Waterfall adding the milk before anything else is done in the task
                     of making a cup of tea.
                    </p>   
                    <br>
                    <p>Kanban is another method employed by businesses to ensure the completion of digital projects. The definition is as follows “Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves 
                        through a process. Kanban visualises both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through that process. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in 
                        your process and fix them so work can flow through it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or throughput.” [2] As stated above Kanban is a visual process. This gives the user an 
                        opportunity to have a full visual of the project broken down allowing them to see any possibilities of streamlining or potential problems down the line.
                    </p>
                    <br>
               <h3>Resources</h3>
                  <br>
                    <p>A list of resources a business could use includes “Digital projects come in all shapes and sizes; Website, Mobile app, Video, Game, Event, Content, E-commerce, Social media, 
                        Advertising, Search engine optimisation” [3] As you can see there are plenty of resources a business can use for digital projects. Probably even more than this!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                   
            <h2>Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? include a link to your Trello board. </h2>        
                 <br>
                    <p>
                        There are numerous methods to plan out tasks using IT- programs like Microsoft excel are widely used in businesses for building data bases to planning schedules.
                    </p>
                  <br>
                    <p>A popular program lots of modern businesses use is trello. I will be using this program to plan out my website. Here is the link if you are interested to see for yourself.
                       <a href = https://trello.com/b/lz3HhKKo/website-project.>My Trello</a> The program is very visual and allows the user to create tasks and drag them from to do, to doing, to done. This gives a methodology
                        to the task and if working in a group will prevent 2 group members from doing the same task as they can be assigned to people.

            <h2>Risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h2>
            <br>
                    <p>There are many risks that may impact digital projects. For example a virus could be highly problematic. Depending on the virus it could completely destroy an entire system or delete essential files. 
                    This would impact a digital project because they couldn’t work without a system to use and if essential files were deleted they would more than likely have to make them again which could result in data 
                    being lost and most likely time being spent doing that.
                    </p>
                <br>
                    <p>Hacking is a risk that could impact digital projects. Especially those with sensitive data that could be compromised by the hack. If a hacker got into any system they could potentially do what they wanted. 
                    Like the man that hacked into the pentagon in America had the power to set off missiles and look at confidential files. This will have compromised all digital projects going on in the pentagon at that time. 
                    They would have had to make security a priority before they carried on with anything else and ensure that no information they didn’t want to be shared was leaked.
                    </p>
                <br>
            <h2>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 
            </h2> 
              <br> 
                  <p>The best way for selecting an IT system would be to ask an expert in that particular industry. So for example if I wanted to look into some kind of construction related project I could ask an architect what they
                    would recommend.
                  </p>
               <br>
                  <p>If an industry expert was not available for whatever reason I could simply google my query. Then I would probably come across material written by industry experts for that particular area.
                  </p>  
                <br>
                  <p>Failing that you could post on forums and facebook pages/groups related to the industry for some recommendations.    
                  </p>
                <br>
            <h2>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control 
            </h2>      
               <br>   
                  <p>Trello has helped massively to plan and implement the project. I have a reference that I can pick up at any point that will indicate how far into the project I am and how much have left to do.
                  </p>
             <br>
            <h2>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h2> 
             <br>
                 <p>GDPR is the General Data Protection Regulation. “What GDPR means is that citizens of the EU and EEA now have greater control over their personal data and assurances that their information is being securely protected across Europe.” [4] 
                 </p>
                 <br>
                 <p>This means that any digital project that involves handling a consumers personal data must take GDPR into consideration. superoffice.com suggest these 5 steps to ensure compliance in any digital project “Map your project’s data, Determine 
                     what data you need to keep, Put security measures in place, Review your documentation and Establish procedures for handling personal data
                    “ [5] If these 5 steps are applied to an existing or new project then they will be GDPR compliant. Please visit the website for more detail on each step.

            <h2>Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2> 
                 <br>
                 <p>First a definition of copyright is “Copyright refers to the legal protection of original works of authorship. This includes literary, written, dramatic, artistic, musical, and other types of creative expression.” [6] Therefore you must be 
                    careful to publish any material that may be copyrighted.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    You will need to ensure that any written publications you are posting are copyright free or that you have explicit permission from the author to share it. The same is for images. Any images you may use on websites must be either original ie 
                    copyright owned (any photo you take is instantly subject to copy-write or you could employ a photographer/ graphic designer etc) or you could use a stock photo website and pay. There are some free stock photo websites like pixabay.com that 
                    have a massive library of royalty free images you could use.
                </p>
                <br>

            <h2>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them </h2>   
                <br>
                <p>An individual with disabilities will view and access a webpage differently from someone without. Therefore this is something that must be taken into account when building a website. There are many features that can be utilised to further a 
                    disabled individuals user experience. Some examples are as follows;
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Large bold font can be of upmost use to an individual with visual impairments. You could take this a step further an even apply audio descriptions to the website so someone that is blind could potentially navigate and access the webpage.                    
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Another example of this could be using effects on the screen to make the screen user friendly for a colour blind person. There is a filter you can download online that is for <a href=https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/.>this</a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>There are many different disabilities and appropriate research into each kind can help developers understand and create accessibility features that will help the disabled users experience.                    
                </p>
                <br>
     
            <h2>Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2> 
                <br>
                <p>The appropriate filetypes for websites are “.AVI | .CSS | .DOC | .EXE | .GIF | .HTML/ .HTM | .JPG/ .JPEG | .MID/ .MIDI | .MP3 | .MPG/ .MPEG | .MOV/ .QT | .PDF | .PNG | .RAM | .RAR | .TIFF | .TXT | .WAV | .ZIP | Streaming Media ]” [7]
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>These file types are necessary to use in a website or it will not work. You can convert other kinds of files to the aforementioned types to make them compatible with your website. For example if you have a PSD (photoshop document) and do not 
                    convert that into a JPEG or a PNG it will not work on the website as it is an inappropriate file type.                    
                </p>
                <br>
                <!-- new questions -->
              <h2>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed- in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? eg Visual Studio Code</h2>  
                <br>
                <p>IT tools are constantly updating and changing. This means that it is necessary to keep up with the ever evolving environment. At this current point in time visual studio code is a highly reputable text editor. "Despite its newbie status, 
                    Visual Studio Code has rapidly gained popularity among developers, ranking as the most popular development environment overall in Stack Overflow’s 2018 Developer Survey."[8] I have tried other text editors, whilst they all essentially do the same 
                thing. I have enjoyed features on VS code such as the live server view. Therefore I have been happy with this technology.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Trello is a great IT tool to keep up to date and on track with your project. You or anyone that is interested can instantly get a visual reference of the projects progress and what stage it is in. In this circumstance I was working alone - I do feel its even more
                useful in group project. Nonetheless, still very useful for individual projects.
                </p>
                <br>
               <h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate eg VS code, Trello</h2> 
                <br>
                <p>I feel the tools selected were appropriate. As aforementioned VS code is a reputable text editor with various useful extentions and is used in the coding industry. Trello is another platform that is not just used in the software development industry, but in many, many others. "Computer Software- Number of companies-3056
                    ,Information Technology and Services-Number of companies-864, Marketing and Advertising-Number of companies-557, Internet-Number of companies-432, Higher Education-Number of companies-417, Retail-Number of companies-350, Hospital & Health Care-Number of companies-328, Education Management-Number of companies-291, Financial Services-Number of companies-241, Nonprofit Organization Management-Number of companies-201"[9] 
                     as you can see this program has universal qualities that apply to many forms of project management
                    </p>
                <br>
               <h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project- are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interest of openness. What would you change?</h2> 
                <br>
                <p>My website has many strengths and conversely, many weaknesses. The strengths of my website are the functionality; it all works, accessibility - the text is all readable, there is a link to a download for colourblind users and alt text for every image. The last strength I would give my website is the consistent theme. The weakenesses of my 
                    website include- not a great design; I feel the css could be improved and lack of individuality- I don't feel that there was aspects of my website that stood out from others.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Overall I am happy with my website, although I do feel there is room for improvement. I would change the CSS to make the design much nicer- I don't feel the design was the best. I would aspire to design it like my personal photography website which I have provided the link for in my about me page. I would also like to try to make my website more individual and unique 
                    with design features, functionality and content itself. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Describe further improvements you can make on your project</h2>
                <br>
                <p>There is always room for improvement, I don't think a 'perfect' website exists. Especially when you factor in that the IT industry is always developing and changing.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Short term improvements I would make are styling- I would want to make the page much nicer for the user. I would also like to add some Java script in maybe making something like a quiz or a contact form to give it that individual touch. 
                    Long term I would constantly update the website in line with the industry standard.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
                <br>
                <p>After completing my website and assessing it frequently as I was going accross the way. I was constantly checking to see if it was meeting the criteria was met. For example all my links worked. The styling was consistent and appropriate. I even got friends and family to review the site so I could adjust it and add improvements. I was always checking for errors myself too, personally going through the website 
                    checking for errors and bugs. I feel I did the best I could with the limited time I had. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency- coukd you have been more efficient when making your webite? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>There are many benefits and drawbacks associated with IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity. For example trello is great for organising your project, however it is time consuming to update. You could argue that you could do a lot more without especially given that you are working alone.
                    Working in a team you could have created a much more advanced website. This would have more pages- functionality. You could have added javascript features. More advanced css and website design. However it would have taken away from the experience of building the whole thing by yourself from start to finish.
                    Great for learning and great for sense of achievement.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>VS code helps massively with the debugging and live server views. Stopping you from having to refresh the page constantly and watching live updates as you code. The debugging tools makes it much harder for you to make errors, which is fantastic! I feel VS code helped a great deal with my efficiency and productivity.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
                <br>
                <p>A potential method to improve productivity and efficiency as previously discussed would be to work in teams. The immediate advantage is having many people working on the same task together. More people can do more work. Well, not always but most of the time they can. You can divide the team up to work on individual parts of the 
                    website giving a higher level of focus concentration and time on each divided area. However working alone means that there is no need for communication between the team. You will have a clear vision of what you want to do and can methodically implement that.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Taking breaks, doing yoga, staying hydrated are further methods you could try to improve your productivity."Yoga has become an increasingly popular activity as a means to promote physical and mental health, both at home and in the workplace. And the more that these two aspects of health are achieved, the more productive people become."[10]
                    Many studies concur with this view and all of the aforementioned are proven to increase productivity and efficiency.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects- what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of slack?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The next time I do this I would potentially work in a team to see how much could be achieved. That would be an interesting fresh angle to approach this project from. As already discussed there are many disadvantages and advantages to working in teams or alone so to see this in practice would be interesting.
                    I would potentially use slack more to send the instructors and other class members drafts of my work for reviews and feedback for me to action. I believe that doing this again there would be a much better result as I now have experience and experience is one of the main keys to increasing productivity.

                <h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
                <br>
                <p>There are numerous methods you can employ to test digital solutions. You can go through the website yourself, to ensure consistency and functionality throughout. Once you have tested it you can send it to others- other developers or anyone that is happy to go through the website. You could test the website in different browsers to see the compatibility and use functions 
                    like developer tools in chrome to further your testing. Test the website on mobile version to see if it is working there and if not then adjust it appropriately for universal compatibility. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I actually tested my site with other members of the course and family members. Then improved it based on the feedback they gave me.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Describe the content and layout for each page</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The Homepage has a simple layout- where in there is no content other than the title of the website, the nav bar and a photograph I took in the Dolomites. I felt a plain homepage is actually more modern and gives a professional look. This is something I have seen on many other websites and thought I would use it for mine.                    
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The about me page has a nice paragraph of content on there explaining about myself. The page also has a link to my website that is currently live on the web and a photo of me.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This page (blog) is more or less, self explanatory, just a straight blog page. With all of the required information on it segregated out with titles and spacing to indicate questions and answers. Then a list of references at the bottom of the pages.

                </p>
